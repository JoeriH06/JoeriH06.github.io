    <h1 class="feedbackH1">My first feedback</h1>

    <p class="feedback">
      Thank you for submitting your “Who Am I?” form. 
      The feedback given here is for you to use when you start the program, so you don’t have to respond to it just now.
      Your motivation seems very general still, the importance in having motivation is that it will serve you during your long study program and motivate you to continue when it becomes hard or overwhelming.
      My advice is to find a more concrete motivation, why do you enjoy programming?
      What makes you want to do it during your everyday role in the future? 
      What do you enjoy in your father`s job?
      en looking at your goals after completing the studies again I would recommend you try and research more because it is too general, maybe search the career opportunities that interest you in ICT, what would you like to do in your day to day?
      How would you like your role to look like? Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses taught.
      I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get more information about different professions in the ICT field.
      Referring to your SWOT analysis, there is a good start of personal reflection. Good questions to ask yourself may be, why you consider it a strength that youll do everything for a project to be perfect? 
      Does it come with a risk or a price? 
      What do you consider a success? 
      What if a project fails or dosent succeed? 
      Notice youll be working with teams during most of the studies program, how will you cooperate with others and what if they don’t see the same solution as you? 
      How will you deal with procrastination? 
      It's nice to see you believe group working will help that but how will you handle it yourself?
      Good to see you are confident in your communication skills, that will be very important during your studies but also your career.
      I am looking forward to meeting you this coming year and wish you a lovely summer break!
      Shirel

    <h2>My thoughts on the feedback</h2>

    <p class="feedback">
      I thought the feedback was justified. I could indeed have put in more information about myself.
      It was indeed a bit general, but when i got the feedback I changed it to something I did not feel was general.
      I changed a lot fo things, for example: 
       <ul class="ulfeedback">
        <li>I did make my motivation more concrete</li>
        <li>I also explained more about my time at my fathers office</li>
        <li>But I still need to look into the jobs after this studie</li>
        <li>I asked myself the SWOT questions and did awnser them</li>
       </ul>
