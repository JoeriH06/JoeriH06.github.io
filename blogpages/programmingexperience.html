      <p> my programming experience</p>
    </h1>

    <p>
      I'm not new to programming I will say. I have programmed before but with a lot of help from google.
      In my last school i worked with python. My teacher made his own programme called tonny editor. We used that programme to make our own code and test it.
      we had a few projects throughout the years. I made my own weather website, that was the first website I ever made. 
      I was proud of what I did, but when I look back on it, it makes me laugh. 
      <br></br>
      I also made a Phyton shooter game. A super retro game that is easy to play and fun to make.
      I already put a picture of my code on my home page, but you can look it up here again. <a href="..\phytonshooter.py"><b>My phyton game </b></a>
      It was super fun to make and to play. I mostly used google to help me but I alo learend from it. You learn by searching the right things up, and by wanting to change the code, you have to understand it.
      So some parts you didnt understand but, there where parts that I understood better because I wanted to change it.
      <br></br>
      throughout the year we also made little projects. Something like, make a squar with phyton turtle. All of these tiny projects make you understand how phyton really works.
      It is the same with html and css. We learend a lot throughout the years by doing random stuff, it was fun to do and fun to learn about these programming languages.
      <br></br>
      I also did some programming at my fathers company. I worked there in my vacation time, I was working there with a good friend of mine. We did some work nobody had time to do and some work that was really fun to do.
      For example we changed the same word on every of the 200 pages. That was really boring, but we also madenew chards and some other new thing. We learend a lot of making new things because we did not understand it yet.
      And by searching things up and making the right things, that is were we put in a difference.
