    <div class="text4">
      <br>I have selected this particular study program due to my keen interest in the subject of "Informatica" and a profound enthusiasm for undertaking various programming projects. Throughout my educational journey, I have had the privilege of engaging in "Informatica" classes that have fostered a deep appreciation for the art of programming. These classes have frequently involved the creation of diverse projects, primarily centered around programming in languages such as Python and other programming paradigms.</br>

      <br>Among the notable projects I have undertaken in these classes, one that stands out is the development of a Python-based game, showcasing the application of programming concepts in an interactive and engaging manner. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to delve into web development, an aspect of programming that I found particularly intriguing. Crafting websites has not only allowed me to harness my creativity but also enhanced my proficiency in programming.</br>

      <br>Moreover, my practical exposure to the world of programming extends beyond the classroom. During a five-week period, I gained valuable experience through vacation work at my father's office. This work primarily revolved around programming tasks and responsibilities. Collaborating closely with a friend who is pursuing an ICT-vmbo course, we embarked on a multitude of projects that involved creating charts and other software solutions essential for the office's operations.</br>
      
      <br>My experience during this vacation work has been transformative in many ways. I have come to appreciate that programming is a discipline that demands unwavering patience and perseverance. It is a field where not everything proceeds according to plan, and the ability to adapt and troubleshoot is paramount. Despite the challenges, I found immense satisfaction in the process and outcomes of our projects.</br>

      <br>It is this very satisfaction and joy that I derived from programming, infused with a sense of purpose and accomplishment, which has led me to choose this specific program of study. My aspiration is to delve deeper into the intricacies of programming languages and their applications, honing my skills and knowledge in this domain. I am eager to embark on this academic journey with the hope of acquiring a comprehensive understanding of computer science and programming, paving the way for a rewarding and fulfilling career in this field.</br>
