    <h1>My personal SWOT</h1>

    <p><b>My strengths</b></p>

     <p>
      Naturally, I hold the belief that my weaknesses are rather limited in number, yet I acknowledge the universal truth that each individual, including myself, possesses areas that warrant improvement. Among these, one of the weaknesses I have come to recognize is a certain hesitance to promptly concede when I have made an error. 
      Additionally, I am aware of the opportunity for growth in the realm of accepting assistance and collaboration from others.
      These areas of self-awareness serve as catalysts for my ongoing personal development journey. 
      I am actively dedicating myself to these self-improvement endeavors, increasingly fostering a mindset that welcomes assistance when it proves essential.
      Furthermore, I am committed to enhancing my self-motivation and self-discipline. While I exhibit proficiency in the realm of planning and organization, maintaining unwavering commitment to my schedules and objectives can sometimes pose a challenge. Consequently, I am diligently cultivating my ability to adhere more consistently to my planned commitments, thus aligning my actions more closely with my aspirations.

    <p><b>My weaknesses</b></p>

    <p>
      Naturally, I tend to believe that I don't possess many weaknesses, but it's a fact that everyone has their own areas of improvement. One of my acknowledged weaknesses is my occasional reluctance to readily admit when I've made a mistake. Furthermore, I recognize that I can enhance my ability to accept assistance.
       These are areas where I've proactively identified room for growth. I am actively engaged in efforts to refine these aspects of myself, increasingly open to seeking help when the situation truly demands it.
      I am also committed to improving my self-initiation skills, aiming to become more proactive in starting tasks. While I excel at planning, I occasionally find it challenging to strictly adhere to my plans. Consequently, I am actively working on enhancing my discipline to better align with my scheduled commitments
