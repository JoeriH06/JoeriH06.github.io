        <h1> Why i chose this study</h1>

        <div class="container2">
            <img class="disceplinepic" src="images/discepline.webp" alt="linkd in">
            <div class="textdiscepline">
                <p>
                    <br>I have selected this particular study program due to my keen interest in the subject of
                    "Informatica" and a profound enthusiasm for undertaking various programming projects. Throughout my
                    educational journey, I have had the privilege of engaging in "Informatica" classes that have
                    fostered a
                    deep appreciation for the art of programming. These classes have frequently involved the creation of
                    diverse projects, primarily centered around programming in languages such as Python and other
                    programming paradigms.</br>

                    <br>Among the notable projects I have undertaken in these classes, one that stands out is the
                    development of a Python-based game, showcasing the application of programming concepts in an
                    interactive
                    and engaging manner. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to delve into web development, an
                    aspect
                    of programming that I found particularly intriguing. Crafting websites has not only allowed me to
                    harness my creativity but also enhanced my proficiency in programming.</br>

                    <br>Moreover, my practical exposure to the world of programming extends beyond the classroom. During
                    a
                    five-week period, I gained valuable experience through vacation work at my father's office. This
                    work
                    primarily revolved around programming tasks and responsibilities. Collaborating closely with a
                    friend
                    who is pursuing an ICT-vmbo course, we embarked on a multitude of projects that involved creating
                    charts
                    and other software solutions essential for the office's operations.</br>

                    <br>My experience during this vacation work has been transformative in many ways. I have come to
                    appreciate that programming is a discipline that demands unwavering patience and perseverance. It is
                    a
                    field where not everything proceeds according to plan, and the ability to adapt and troubleshoot is
                    paramount. Despite the challenges, I found immense satisfaction in the process and outcomes of our
                    projects.</br>

                    <br>It is this very satisfaction and joy that I derived from programming, infused with a sense of
                    purpose and accomplishment, which has led me to choose this specific program of study. My aspiration
                    is
                    to delve deeper into the intricacies of programming languages and their applications, honing my
                    skills
                    and knowledge in this domain. I am eager to embark on this academic journey with the hope of
                    acquiring a
                    comprehensive understanding of computer science and programming, paving the way for a rewarding and
                    fulfilling career in this field.</br>
