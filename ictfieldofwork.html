                <p>
                    There are many jobs open such as: backend engineer, IOS engineer, brand designer, product designer,
                    product manager and many more.
                </p>

                <h2><br><b>The Culture inside Utility</b></br></h2>

                <p>
                    Although the company is very remote, they have offices in NYC. These offices are looking very cosy
                    and fun.
                    I think the people there love working and helping eachother. The office is made like it is your
                    home, they did this so it makes you
                    more comfertable to work in the office.

                </p>

                <h2><br><b>Would I see myself working here?</b></br></h2>

                <p>
                    I dont think I would see myself working there, the reason for that is because it is all remote or I
                    have to move to LA or NYC.
                    I Know I like working around people and having conversations. Also you cannot reach out super fast
                    to one of your colleagues.
                    I'm a social person so I dont think this company suits me the best.
