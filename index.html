  <!--reference to my phyton game-->

    <br>Motivation is a powerful driving force that fuels our aspirations and keeps us moving forward, even in the face of
    challenges and uncertainty. In my journey through the ICT program and my pursuit of programming skills, I have
    discovered a profound and ever-evolving wellspring of motivation that continues to shape my path and fuel my
    enthusiasm.

    <br>When I first embarked on this ICT program, I had only a vague idea of what lay ahead. The initial days were filled
    with excitement and a hint of trepidation. But as I delved deeper into the curriculum, I found myself immersed in a
    world of endless possibilities. The ICT program, to my delight, turned out to be not just informative but incredibly
    enjoyable.

    <br>The irony lies in the fact that before I joined this program, I was oblivious to the sheer joy it would bring me. My
    initial perception of ICT was somewhat limited. I knew I had an affinity for technology and had thoroughly enjoyed
    my informatics lessons in my previous school. However, I had no inkling of the vast realm of knowledge, creativity,
    and innovation that awaited me.</br>

    <br>My prior exposure to concepts like Python, HTML, and CSS during those informatics lessons had already sparked a
    fascination within me. I was enamored by the fact that these seemingly cryptic codes could be wielded to craft
    digital wonders. What appealed to me most was the notion that the answers to intricate problems were just a few
    lines of code away, nestled within the confines of my device. It was like having a magical key that unlocked the
    doors to a universe of digital marvels.</br>

    <br>But there was more to my motivation than just the allure of technology. I harbored a deep desire to understand the
    art and science of programming. I wanted to decipher the logic behind those lines of code, to unravel the mysteries
    of algorithms, and to create solutions that could make a difference in the world. And it was within the confines of
    the ICT program that I believed I would find the best environment to nurture this aspiration.</br>

    <br>As I navigate this program, my hopes and expectations remain high. I hope that the promises of a comprehensive
    understanding of ICT and programming are fulfilled. I anticipate gaining the knowledge and skills that will not only
    satisfy my curiosity but also prepare me for a future filled with opportunities.</br>

    <br>To add a more formal structure to my motivation, I have taken steps to ensure that my learning journey is organized
    and purposeful. One of the key elements of this structure is goal setting. I firmly believe that setting clear and
    achievable goals is essential for maintaining motivation and measuring progress. I have outlined specific objectives
    for each phase of my ICT program, from mastering programming languages to completing challenging projects. These
    goals serve as guiding lights, keeping me focused on what I want to accomplish.</br>

    <br>Furthermore, I have created a meticulous study plan. This plan delineates the topics I need to cover, the resources
    I need to consult, and the amount of time I should allocate to each study session. Having a well-structured plan not
    only prevents procrastination but also ensures that I cover the necessary material thoroughly.</br>

    <br> To formalize my commitment to this journey, I maintain a detailed learning journal. This journal serves as a formal
    record of my daily progress, insights, challenges, and achievements. It provides me with a tangible representation
    of my growth and development. Reflecting on my journal entries allows me to identify areas where I need improvement
    and celebrate the milestones I have reached.</br>

    <br> In addition to these personal strategies, I have sought external sources of motivation and support. I have partnered
    with a fellow enthusiast from my program to create a mutual accountability system. We hold each other responsible
    for completing assignments, projects, or study goals, ensuring that we stay on track and consistently challenge
    ourselves.</br>

    <br> Moreover, I have considered formal courses and certifications as a means to augment my knowledge and validate my
    skills. These courses provide a structured and standardized approach to learning, aligning with my aspiration for a
    formal and rigorous education in ICT and programming.</br>

    <br>In conclusion, my motivation for the ICT program and programming transcends mere interest; it embodies a fervent
    passion and a thirst for knowledge. It is the culmination of my fascination with technology, my desire to unlock the
    mysteries of code, and my commitment to personal and professional growth. With clear goals, a structured plan, a
    meticulous journal, and a supportive community, I have formalized my commitment to this journey. I am determined to
    learn, to excel, and to embrace the opportunities that lie ahead in the realm of ICT and programming. This
    motivation, deeply ingrained in my heart and mind, is the driving force that propels me forward with unwavering
    determination and enthusiasm.<br> Here I will show you an example of what I build -----></br>

  <!--countries i visited-->
  <p style="padding: 1%;">
    Ofcourse only learing about programming is not the only reason I chose ICT. I really like exploring other cultures
    and I thought it would be fun to do That
    in a international course. And because HBO-ICT also had a international course it pulled the lever for me. I love
    talking English with other people,
    because it helps my grammer and it is an alround language. I love travelling so that helped me to practise my
    English and understand more cultures.
    Here are some places I went to:
  <ol>
    <li>Iceland</li>
    <li>England</li>
    <li>Spain</li>
    <li>France</li>
    <li>Denmark</li>
    <li>Sweden</li>
    <li>Norway</li>
    <li>Most of europe</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="container5">
    Ofcourse I have fantastic photo's but I want to show you the best one:
    <img src="images/Iceland.JPG" alt="Iceland" class="image2">
  </div>
  <p style="padding: 1%;" class="text3">
    <br>I think international course suits me the best because we are also going to do international trips. <br>So that
    means 2 of my things are going to be together.
    <br>We are also going to do a internship, I hope I can do the internship outside of the Netherlands, I think that
    would be a "dream".
    Here I will put a link where you can see, where we can do an internship.
