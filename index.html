    <h1><b>Why I chose HBO-ICT:</b></h1>

    <p>

      The ICT-programme is a very fun programme. I have enjoyed the first few days. But before I came to the programme I didnt knew that ofcourse.
        I thought it suited me because I really enjoyed the informatica lessons in my last school. We learned about phyton,html and css. 
        I enjoyed it because you can always find the awnsers on your device. You can learn a lot about it just by looking into it.
        I also wanted to learn to programme and I thought that with this programme I would learn it the best.
        I hope that my expectations are true and I will really enjoy the programme.
    </p>

    <p>I also made a few games already with python. I did these with a lot of help from my mates.
      but I really liked building these games. Here I will show you an example of what I build ----->
    </p>

    <p> here I will also show you my phyton game in code:

    </p>

    <p>   
      Ofcourse only learing about programming is not the only reason I chose ICT. I really like exploring other cultures and I thought it would be fun to do That
      in a international course. And because HBO-ICT also had a international course it pulled the lever for me. I love talking English with other people,
      because it helps my grammer and it is an alround language. I love travelling so that helped me to practise my English and understand more cultures.
      Here are some places I went to:
      <ol>
        <li>Iceland</li>
        <li>England</li>
        <li>Spain</li>
        <li>France</li>
        <li>Denmark</li>
        <li>Sweden</li>
        <li>Norway</li>
        <li>Most of europe</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Ofcourse I have fantastic photo's but I want to show you the best one:

    <h2>
      Other reasons
    </h2>

    <p>
      I think international course suits me the best because we are also going to do international trips. So that means 2 of my things are going to be together.
      We are also going to do a internship, I hope I can do the internship outside of the Netherlands, I think that would be a "dream".
      Here I will put a link where you can see, where we can do an internship.
