    <br>"Motivation is the powerful force that drives us forward, even in the face of challenges. In my journey through the
         ICT program and programming, I've discovered a profound wellspring of motivation.</br>

    <br>When I started, I had a vague idea of what to expect. However, as I delved deeper into the curriculum, I found it
        not only informative but enjoyable.</br>

    <br>Before this program, I underestimated the joy it would bring. My initial perception of ICT was limited. But my prior
        exposure to Python, HTML, and CSS had already sparked my fascination.</br>

    <br>As I navigate this program, my hopes remain high. I anticipate gaining knowledge and skills that will prepare me for
        the future.</br>

    <br> I also plan to take formal courses and certifications to augment my knowledge. These provide a structured approach
         to my education.</br>

    <br>In conclusion, my motivation for ICT and programming embodies a passion for technology, a desire to unlock code's
        mysteries, and a commitment to growth. With clear goals and a supportive community, I am determined to excel in this
        journey.</br>

    <br>here I will also show you my phyton game in code:

  <!--countries i visited-->
  <p style="padding: 1%;">
    Ofcourse only learing about programming is not the only reason I chose ICT. I really like exploring other cultures
    and I thought it would be fun to do That
    in a international course. And because HBO-ICT also had a international course it pulled the lever for me. I love
    talking English with other people,
    because it helps my grammer and it is an alround language. I love travelling so that helped me to practise my
    English and understand more cultures.
    Here are some places I went to:
  <ol>
    <li>Iceland</li>
    <li>England</li>
    <li>Spain</li>
    <li>France</li>
    <li>Denmark</li>
    <li>Sweden</li>
    <li>Norway</li>
    <li>Most of europe</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="container5">
    Ofcourse I have fantastic photo's but I want to show you the best one:
    <img src="images/Iceland.JPG" alt="Iceland" class="image2">

  <p style="padding: 1%;" class="text3">
    <br>I think international course suits me the best because we are also going to do international trips. <br>So that
    means 2 of my things are going to be together.
    <br>We are also going to do a internship, I hope I can do the internship outside of the Netherlands, I think that
    would be a "dream".
    Here I will put a link where you can see, where we can do an internship.
