                          <b>Some hobbies:</b>
                              <br>
                                     I love playing sports, I go to the gym 5 to 6 times a week.
                                    I also love playing and watching football (not soccer). You can ask me anything about ongoing and upcoming games and I will awnser it with joy.
                                    I support ajax and FC barcelona, i watch them since is was very little. Thanks to the playing style of Barcelona i fell in love with watching football.
                                    Lionel messi was the most important man of that team and for sure the best. It was something you have never seen before.
                                    that man made me love football.
                                    But for the most part I am open for many activites. Just ask me and if i have the time I will gladly play some sports with anyone.
