                        North Sea to
                        the port of Antwerp in Belgium. This makes it an important hub for maritime and industrial

                        the supply
                        chain for the European market.</li>
                    <li>Tourism: While primarily an industrial city, Terneuzen also attracts tourists, especially those
                        interested
                        in maritime history and culture. The city has a historic center with picturesque canals,
                        museums, and a
                        variety of shops and restaurants.</li>
                    <li>Living in Terneuzen: If you live in Terneuzen, your perception of the city may vary depending on
                        your

                        the city
                        include its relatively peaceful atmosphere, access to the waterfront, and proximity to nature
                        reserves and
                        recreational areas.</li>

                    <br>
                    I still live with all of my familly members at home. I have an older sister who is 19, and a younger
                    brother who is 13.
                    I also have a dog who is very excited. It is a beautifull dog and you may see some pictures of him
                    this year.
                    I think we are a great familly because we love doing stuff together. But we are Dutch so we can be a
                    little chaos :) .
                    </br>
                    <br>
                    I also have a super fun friendgroup. We do so much together that it almost feels like we are a
                    familly.
                    I had a super time with them in highschool and now at the HZ we still keep contact.

                    <b>Some hobbies:</b>
                    <br>
                    I love playing sports, I go to the gym 5 to 6 times a week.
                    I also love playing and watching football (not soccer). You can ask me anything about ongoing and
                    upcoming games and I will awnser it with joy.
                    I support ajax and FC barcelona, i watch them since is was very little. Thanks to the playing style
                    of Barcelona i fell in love with watching football.
                    Lionel messi was the most important man of that team and for sure the best. It was something you
                    have never seen before.
                    that man made me love football.
                    But for the most part I am open for many activites. Just ask me and if i have the time I will gladly
                    play some sports with anyone.
